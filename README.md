# Syllabus

## Modern Web Programming (COMP 426)

In this course, we will take a very practical, hands-on approach to learning how to design, build, and interact with web APIs, back-end server applications, and front-end client apps and interfaces. 

We will also focus on learning some "soft skills" that often go by the wayside, including collaborative development workflows, project management, reading and understanding errors, reading and writing documentation, and maintaining healthy work practices.

We will discuss licensing and make use of and operate entirely within open source ecosystems.

#### Learning management systems disclaimer

There is no Sakai or Canvas site for this course. Sakai is garbage and Canvas is a corporate surveillance tool. I will not subject myself or any of you to either of them in the context of this course. If you do not like this, please feel free to drop the class.

#### Email

If you need to speak with a member of the instructional staff directly through private communication channels about a private matter, please use the email addresses listed above. Anything you communicate in this manner will be held in confidence.

_If your email communication is about an assignment, then you will be asked to create an issue._

_If your communication is about general course information or course topics, then you will be asked to create a discussion post._

There are hundreds of members of this class and few instructional staff. The systems that we have set up to address communication are there to manage this workload so that we may provide you with the information you need while also not burning ourselves out.
