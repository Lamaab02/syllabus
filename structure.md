# Course structure

## Modern Web Programming (COMP 426)

### Class sessions

Your instructor is going to attempt to record short lectures for distribution before class and then use the in-person sessions as discusson and work time. 

We will see how that goes and adjust as necessary.

Some class time will be reserved for you to work with your teams on final projects. 

### Remote availability

Class sessions are all going to be available to stream live on Zoom.
This is intended to help manage dealing with ongoing uncertainty regarding... well, everything.

### Session recordings

Sessions will all be recorded and archived in Panopto so that you can access them later.
